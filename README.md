# Welcome to Conway's Game of Life!

I want to clarify that this project it's pretty simple, I just wanted to code this in order to know if I was cool enough to do it :)

# How to run?

2 Simple ways

### Just do it

```
node index.js
```

Or with an specific size

```
node index.js -l 64
```

### 'Dev mode'

First install npm packages

```
npm install
```

Then run it with npm

```
npm run dev
```

The difference is that doing it in this way you are using [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) so the script is executed every time you save changes on the project and you are allowed to see the changes pretty fast.
