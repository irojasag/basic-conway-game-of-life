# Welcome to Conway's Game of Life!

I want to clarify that this project it's pretty simple, I just wanted to code this in order to know if I was cool enough to do it :) 


# How to run?

2 Simple ways

### Just do it
```
node index.js
```
Or with an specific size
```
node index.js -l 64
```

### 'Dev mode'
First install npm packages
```
npm install
```
Then run it with npm
```
npm run start
```
The difference is that doing it in this way you are using [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) so the script is executed every time you save changes on the project and you are allowed to see the changes pretty fast.
